DBIx-DataStore

This module provides a relatively light wrapper around Perl's DBI. With
DBIx::DataStore, you gain some conveniences in DSN configuration, query
placeholders (use arrays for IN clauses!), automatic pagination of
results, and more.

What you do not get is an ORM, or any black magic that attempts to
outsmart you on your own database schemas. This may be a good or a bad
thing, depending on how much control you like to cede, or how much
grunt work you would rather avoid. With DBIx::DataStore, you still
write all your own SQL directly. DBIx::DataStore just tries to make
the interaction with the database handlers a little easier, and a
little cleaner.
